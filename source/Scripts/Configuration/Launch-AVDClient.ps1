<# 
.SYNOPSIS
    This script launches the Remote Desktop Client for Windows and automatically subscribes to the Feed. It performs different monitoring
    actions depending on the parameters or user for who the script is running (i.e., it will create a WMI Event Subscription with actions
    if the $Autologon or $Yubikey are set to $true.). The script also monitors the Remote Desktop client for Windows process and takes actions
    when the process exits depending on exit code.

.DESCRIPTION 
    This script first creates a WMI Event Subscriber that looks for the removal of a PNP device that matches either a YUBIKEY (Vendor ID 1050)
    or a Smart Card (PNPDeviceID always starts with SCFILTER). This subscription is configured with an action to relaunch this script and kill
    the PowerShell process executing this instance if the logged in user is 'KioskUser0' because this is an autologon kiosk user and lock the
    computer if it is any other user.

    After the WMI Subscriber is created, the script then launches the AVD Client with a command line that it determines based on the signed-in
    user and whether there is cached credential information for the user in the AVD client. When launching the client, the process details are
    passed through to this script.

    The script monitors the MSRDCW process (AVD Client) every 5 seconds until there is an exit code. Once there is an exit code, the script
    either restarts this script and kills the parent PowerShell process when the signed-in user is 'KioskUser0' or logs the user off if the
    signed-in user was not 'KioskUser0' and the exit code is 0 indicating that the user clicked the 'X' button at the top right of the AVD
    Client.
 
.NOTES 
    The query for the WMI Event Subscription can be adjusted to run more/less frequently on the line that begins with '$Query'. The time is an
    integer value in Seconds and found after 'WITHIN'. Default is 5 seconds.

.COMPONENT 
    No PowerShell modules required.

.PARAMETER AutoLogon
    This boolean value determines if the Thin Client is configured with the Autologon account. If not, and without DeviceQuery Parameters, then the WMI
    event subscription is not created.

.PARAMETER DeviceVendorID
    This string value is the Vendor ID of the device to monitor for removal. The default is an empty string.

.PARAMETER SmartCard
    This boolean value determines if the WMI Event Subscription monitors for Smart Card Removal. Default = $True

.PARAMETER SubscribeUrl
    This value determines the Url of the Remote Desktop Feed which varies by environment. The placeholder in this script is/was automatically
    updated by the installation script.
    The list of Urls can be found at
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/users/connect-microsoft-store?source=recommendations#subscribe-to-a-workspace.

.PARAMETER Timeout
    This integer value determines the time in seconds that can pass with cached credentials in the Remote Desktop Client and no remote sessions connections. Default = 900 seconds.

.PARAMETER Triggers
    This array value determines the triggers for the actions that this script will take. The choices are ( 'SessionDisconnect', 'SessionDisconnect' and 'IdleTimeout' or 'IdleTimeout' )  or 'DeviceRemoval'.

.PARAMETER TriggerAction
    The action this script executes when the Trigger occurs. The choices are 'Lock', 'Logoff', 'ResetClient'.

                        Occurs when X is select on the RDP window. Need to test in session disconnect option.

                        Reason 2
                        Occurs when disconnect is selected in start menu on Session Host
                        Occurs when logoff is select in session

                        Occurs when session is disconnected by a connection to the same host from another endpoint. Must be treated differently to prevent cached credentials from remaining.
